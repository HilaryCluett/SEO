SEO Keyword Strategy
  Page Title 
    The page title is in the heading of the code.
    The first marketing message users will see.
    <head>
    <title> HCFU </title>
    </head>
  
  The code appears for users in search engines as follows:
  Page Title
    blue and underlined
    65 character limit
  URL
    green
  Description
    black
  Sitelinks 
    blue
    
   Formats of Page Titles:
    Seperator (65 characters, 2nd sentence 70 characters)
    Headline (2 - 3 words)
    List
    Short sentence format
    Keyword-dense (keyword, keyword, keyword, keyword)
    Keyword-order
    No Keyword - if you have a highly relevant domain
  
  Idea is to rank for a specific set of words
  
  Page Structure
    Navigation
      navigational links
    Headings - Like Headlines

 CODE - Page Structures
 Pagetitle
 HomePage <h1 container, 1 per page>
 Navigation <link to each page, names being used in the navigation>
 Paragraph of content <work in a keyword naturally>
 Video <details about the movie>
 
 Search engines need HTML markup as a set of instructions to build the desired page
 
 Scan-ability
  Non linear
  Eyes sweep a page for fixation points - to see if the type of information is correct
  Use keywords as fixation points in content
  
    Headlines
    Sub-headings
    Bulleted Lists
    Bold
    Hyperlinks
    Subscribe buttons (action graphics)
    
  Search engines look at the site like users look at a newspaper.
